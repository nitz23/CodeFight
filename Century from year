Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Example

For year = 1905, the output should be
centuryFromYear(year) = 20;
For year = 1700, the output should be
centuryFromYear(year) = 17.

def centuryFromYear(year):
        return (year-1)// 100) +1
    
print(centuryFromYear(1905))


#Top solutions
1. def centuryFromYear(year):
    return (year + 99) // 100
    
2. def centuryFromYear(year):
    
    year = year / 100
    
    if year == int(year):
        return year
    else:
        return int(year) + 1
