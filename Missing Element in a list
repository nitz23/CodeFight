For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3.(Misiing elements)

Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7, which is missing in his list.


def makeArrayConsecutive2(statues):
    miss = []
    for i in range(min(statues),max(statues)+1):
        if i not in statues:
            miss.append(i)
    return len(miss)











Other Solution:

def makeArrayConsecutive2(statues):
    return max(statues) - min(statues) - len(statues) + 1
